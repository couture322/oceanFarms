# oceanFarms

The code here are for a spatial age structured population model simulating fish and fisheries around ocean farms. Farm impacts tested include changes to fish movement (attraction), protection from fishing, and impacts on survival (natural mortality). This model was developed for my PhD dissertation at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara with the help of my committee members: Darcy Bradley, Steve Gaines, Ben Halpern
